Dimension reduction are data processing techniques which reduces multi-dimensional data down to smaller, manageable dimensions.  This makes it easier for humans and machines to visualize patterns within the data.  We will be incorporating several of these techniques into a stand-alone application that serves as a “toolbox” that acts to help users decide which technique is most applicable to their data.
Features of the toolbox include:
> Data Importer (i.e.:  CSV files, Images)
> Data Processing (i.e.:  Reduction techniques like MDS, LLE)
> Data Representation (i.e.: 2D & 3D Graphs)
We will implement the aforementioned features using the .NET development framework, specifically C#.
